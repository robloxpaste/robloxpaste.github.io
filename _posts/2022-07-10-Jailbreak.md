## Roblox Jailbreak Script Features

Jailbreak is a popular game on Roblox that allows players to break out of jail and become criminals. The game features many different scripts that players can use to perform various actions, such as robbing stores or escaping from the police.

One of the most popular scripts in Jailbreak is the "Rob" script, which allows players to rob stores. This script can be used to rob any store in the game, including banks and jewelry stores. When using this script, players will need to enter the store and then type in the "rob" command. This will cause their character to pull out a gun and hold up the store clerk. Once the clerk has been robbed, the player will receive a small amount of money.

Another popular script in Jailbreak is the "Escape" script, which allows players to escape from the police. This script can be used when a player is being chased by the police and they want to lose them. To use this script, players will need to type in the "escape" command while they are being chased. This will cause their character to climb over a fence or jump into a manhole, depending on where they are located. Once they have escaped, the police will no longer be able to chase them.

There are many other scripts in Jailbreak that players can use to perform various actions. These scripts can be used to do things like driving cars, flying helicopters, or even hacking into security cameras. There are also scripts that allow players to change their appearance, such as by changing their hair color or adding tattoos.
