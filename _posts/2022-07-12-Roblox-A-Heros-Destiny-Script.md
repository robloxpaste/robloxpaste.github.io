## What Are The Controls For A Hero's Destiny?
When you start A Hero's Destiny, you will be asked to choose your controls. There are three different options- Keyboard, Mouse and Gamepad. Each control has its own benefits and drawbacks, so it is important to choose the one that works best for you.

Keyboard: This is the traditional way to play the game. The keys on the keyboard are used to move around and interact with the game. It is easy to use and beginner friendly, but it can get cumbersome if you need to change positions frequently.

Mouse: This is the easiest way to play the game. You simply use the mouse to move around and click on things to do things. It is comfortable and efficient, but it can be difficult if you have poor hand-eye coordination.

Gamepad: This is the most advanced way to play the game. Using a gamepad allows you to control everything with buttons instead of using keys on your keyboard or mouse. This makes navigation much easier and more accurate, but it can be confusing for new players who are not used to controlling games this way.

There are a few ways to win in A Hero's Destiny. The first way is to complete the main story arcs and tasks that are offered to you by the game.
