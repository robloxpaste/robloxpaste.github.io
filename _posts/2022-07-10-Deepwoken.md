## How To Use Roblox Weapon Fighting Simulator Script

Deepwoken is a powerful scripting tool that allows you to create custom game experiences on Roblox. With Deepwoken, you can create anything from simple chat commands to complex game mechanics.

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to get started with Deepwoken and create a simple script that will allow you to teleport to any location in the world.

First, you'll need to install the Deepwoken Scripting Tool. You can find it here:

https://www.roblox.com/library/133037677/Deepwoken-Scripting-Tool

Once you have the tool installed, launch it and click the "New Script" button. A new window will appear with a blank script template.

Next, we'll need to add a few lines of code to our script. In the "onTeleport" function, we'll add the following line:

game.Workspace.CurrentCamera.CameraSubject = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character;

This line of code will tell the game to set the camera's focus to the local player's character when they teleport. This will ensure that the player always sees their character on screen when they teleport.

Now we just need to add a command that will trigger our teleportation code. In the "onCommand" function, we'll add the following line:

if (cmd == "/teleport") { onTeleport(); }

This line of code will check if the player has typed in the "/teleport" command, and if they have, it will call the "onTeleport" function we created earlier. Now whenever a player types in "/teleport", they'll be teleported to their current location.

That's all there is to it! With just a few lines of code, you've created a fully functioning teleportation system with Deepwoken. As you can see, Deepwoken is an incredibly powerful tool that can help you create custom game experiences on Roblox like never before!
