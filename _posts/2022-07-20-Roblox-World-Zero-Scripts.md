## What Is Roblox World Zero?
Roblox World Zero is a new game that was just released on July 26th. It's a survival game where players have to fight against zombies and other enemies in an open world environment. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world and players can build and customize their own characters.

## Is it safe to have a fire pit on the grass?

Yes you can have a fire pit on the grass! But you shouldn't do it unless you are prepared for the consequences. The fact is, having a fire pit on the grass is highly dangerous and if done incorrectly, you could hurt yourself or even worse, start a fire!

The first thing to think about is your location. The best location for your fire pit would be in an open area- preferably on concrete or pavers. You want to avoid putting your fire pit on dirt because when the wood ashes fall onto the ground, that's where they will stay until they are washed away. If you were to put your fire pit on dirt, the ashes could easily spread and get into the grass. Fire pits should also be far enough away from trees so that your embers don't end up falling onto any branches or leaves that could easily catch on fire.

The next step for safety is purchasing a fire pit that has been elevated off of the ground so that it does not come in contact with any part of your body or clothing. If at all possible, try to purchase a fire pit that allows you to stand directly underneath of it so that if any sparks end up falling they will land below instead of hitting you in the face. Finally, always keep an eye on your surroundings and make sure no one else is around when you are starting your fire; there's nothing more frustrating than trying to enjoy your time around a campfire only to find out someone else was careless and started their own blaze nearby!
