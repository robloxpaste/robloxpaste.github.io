Most scripts will come in the form of a .lua file, which can be opened and edited with any text editor. Once you have the script open, you'll need to copy and paste it into the appropriate place in your Roblox Rift Battle Royale folder.

Finally, you'll need to launch the game and enable the script. This can usually be done by pressing a specific key combination (such as F5) while in-game.
