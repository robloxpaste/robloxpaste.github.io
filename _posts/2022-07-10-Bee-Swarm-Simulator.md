## Roblox Bee Swarm Simulator Script Features

Welcome to the latest edition of the Roblox Bee Swarm Simulator scripts! This time around we've got some great new features to share with you, including a brand new way to get nectar and some new ways to use your bees!

One of the biggest new additions is the ability to get nectar from flowers without having to go near them! Now you can just stand next to a flower and your bees will automatically start collecting nectar for you. This is a great way to get started on your beekeeping journey, and it's also a great way to get nectar when there aren't any flowers nearby.

We've also added some new uses for your bees! Now you can use them to pollinate crops and trees, which will help you get more honey and wax. You can also use them to defend your hive from invading insects. Just deploy your bees near an enemy insect and they'll take care of the rest!

That's all for this edition of the Roblox Bee Swarm Simulator scripts. We hope you enjoy these new features and we'll see you next time!
