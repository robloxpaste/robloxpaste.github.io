Schools should have a dress code policy because it is important for students to be dressed in appropriate attire when they are in school. It is also important for schools to maintain a professional appearance. When students are appropriately dressed, it will make them look more respectable and help them to behave better in class.

## Conclusion
There is no strict policy as of now in schools, but having one can be beneficial for a number of reasons. For example, if there is a dress code policy at school then students know what is expected of them and they are not asked to alter their clothing to comply with the policy. This can create a more efficient campus since there are fewer disruptions and misunderstandings. There is also the potential for disciplinary action if the dress code policy is not followed. Overall, enforcing a dress code policy can lead to improved school culture and an overall more orderly environment.
