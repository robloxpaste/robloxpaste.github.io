## What Is A Clicker Simulator?
A clicker simulator is a software program that people use to learn how to click on things. It's like playing a video game, but you don't have to use your hands. You can use a mouse or touch screen. Some clicker simulators are online and you play them on your computer, while others are downloadable and you can play them on your phone or tablet.

One of the most common uses for a clicker simulator is learning how to train animals. You can use it to teach your dog to sit, jump, fetch and more. You can also use it to help kids learn how to read, write and count.
