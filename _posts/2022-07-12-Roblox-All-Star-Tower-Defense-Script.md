## What Are The Different Types Of Towers In All Star Tower Defense?
There are a few different types of towers in All Star Tower Defense. These towers can be used to defend your base or to attack the enemy's base. The different types of towers include:

1. Wall: A wall is a defensive tower that is used to protect your base from attacks. Walls can be built on either side of the player's base, and they can be upgraded to increase their protection.
2. Gate: Gates are used to allow players into or out of their base. Gates can be opened or closed, and they also have a defense rating so that enemies will have a harder time attacking through them.
3. Archer: Archers are special towers that are used to shoot arrows at the enemy's base. Arrow shots can damage both buildings and troops, and archers can also be upgraded to fire more powerful arrows.

Different types of towers require different types of resources to upgrade. For example, a Cannon tower requires gold and stones to upgrade, while an Air Attack tower requires wood and air power.

To upgrade your towers, go to the town hall and click on the “Towers” icon. On the “Towers” screen, you will see all of your active towers and their status. To upgrade a tower, click on the icon next to the tower name and select the type of resource you need.
