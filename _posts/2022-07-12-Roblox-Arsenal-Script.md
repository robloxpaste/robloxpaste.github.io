## What Is Roblox Arsenal?

## Is it safe to have a fire pit on Roblox?

Yes, you can have a fire pit on Roblox as long as you are aware of the dangers involved. The fact is, having a fire pit on the grass is highly dangerous and if done incorrectly, you could hurt yourself or even worse, start a fire!

The first thing to think about is your location. The best location for your fire pit would be in an open area- preferably on concrete or pavers. You want to avoid putting your fire pit on dirt because when the wood ashes fall onto the ground, that's where they will stay until they are washed away. If you were to put your fire pit on dirt, the ashes could easily spread and get into the grass. Fire pits should also be far enough away from trees so that your embers don't end up falling onto any branches or leaves that could easily catch on fire.

The next step for safety is purchasing a fire pit that has been elevated off of the ground so that it does not come in contact with any part of your body or clothing. If at all possible, try to purchase a fire pit that allows you to stand directly underneath of it so that if any sparks end up falling, you will not be injured.
