You will need to replace this line of code with the following: "local player = game.Workspace.CurrentCamera.CameraSubject". This new line of code will tell the script to use your current camera view as your character.

The next thing you will need to do is find the line of code that says "player:LoadAnimation(script)" and delete it. This line of code is no longer necessary and will only cause errors if left in the script.
