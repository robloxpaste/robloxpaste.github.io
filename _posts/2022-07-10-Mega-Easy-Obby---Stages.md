## How To Use Roblox Mega Easy Obby Stages Script
Hello everyone! In this blog post, I'm going to show you how to use the Roblox Mega Easy Obby Stages script. This script is incredibly useful if you want to create an obby with multiple stages.

First, open up the script in your text editor of choice. I recommend using Notepad++ or Sublime Text. Once you have the script open, scroll down to the bottom and find the section labeled "Stage 1."

In this section, you will see a bunch of code that looks like this:

stage1 = {
 {0,0,0}, -- start position
 {1,1,1}, -- end position
}

The first thing you need to do is change the start and end positions to match your own obby. To do this, simply change the numbers in between the curly braces. The first set of numbers corresponds to the start position, and the second set corresponds to the end position. Make sure that you don't delete any of the other code in this section!

Once you've updated the positions, scroll down to the "Stage 2" section and repeat these steps. You can continue doing this for as many stages as you want. Just make sure that each stage has its own unique start and end positions.

That's all there is to it! Using this script is a great way to save time when creating an obby with multiple stages. I hope this tutorial was helpful.
