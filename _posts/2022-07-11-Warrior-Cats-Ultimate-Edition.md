## How Does The Game Work?

Warrior Cats is a game that pits two teams of cats against each other in an all-out battle. The game is played on a large board with several different types of terrain, and each team has their own set of cats with different abilities.

The objective of the game is to be the first team to capture the other team's base, or to have the most cats remaining at the end of the game. The game can be won in a number of ways, but it usually comes down to strategic planning and luck.

There are four different types of cats in the game: Warriors, Rogues, Kits, and Elders. Each type of cat has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to choose the right mix of cats for your team.

The game is turn-based, so each team takes turns moving their cats around the board. During each turn, a player can move one cat or all of their cats, depending on what they want to do. They can also use special abilities if they have them.

The game ends when one team either captures the other team's base, or there are no more cats remaining on one side. At that point, the team with the most cats left on the board is declared the winner.
