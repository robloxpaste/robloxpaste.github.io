## What Is The Roblox Big Brain Simulator?

Being a good friend can be hard, but it is important. It can be difficult to know what to do when someone is sad or needs help, but being a good friend means doing whatever you can. Here are some tips on how to be a good friend:

 - Listen carefully. When someone is talking, don't rush them and wait for them to finish before you say anything. If you need to interrupt them, do so politely.
 - Don't judge. Sometimes people feel really down or embarrassed and they don't want other people to know that. It's okay to be quiet when you don't know what to say, but please don't ignore the person. Let them know that you care about them and will listen if they want to talk again.
 - Be patient. It may take a little bit for someone to open up, but patience is key. If the person does eventually want to talk, be there for them and offer your support.
