Script 1: this script enables players to chop trees. When a player chops a tree, they are rewarded with wood and tree saplings. The number of trees chopped per minute also affects the player's Woodcutting Rank. The higher the rank, the more stamina they have and the faster they can chop trees.

Script 2: this script deals with construction projects. When a player builds a structure or an equipment, they are rewarded with experience points (XP) and money. XP is used to increase a playerâ€™s stats, while money can be used to buy items at the shops or to repair damaged structures or equipments.

Script 3: this script handles the migration of players between servers. Whenever a new server is started, all the players that were registered on the old server are automatically transferred to the new one. This script also takes care of adding friends from other servers so that they can join your game easily.
