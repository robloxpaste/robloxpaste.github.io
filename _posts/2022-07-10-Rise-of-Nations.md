## How To Use Roblox Rise Of Nations Script
Roblox Rise of Nations is a game that allows you to script your own events and actions. You can use this scripting language to create custom game modes, automate processes, or even just make the game more fun for yourself. The possibilities are endless!

To get started, you'll need to install the Rise of Nations Modding Kit. This will give you all the tools you need to start scripting. Once you have the kit installed, open up the "Script Editor" from the main menu.

Now it's time to start writing some code! The first thing you'll need to do is create a new file. To do this, click on the "File" menu and select "New." This will open up a blank document for you to start coding in.

Now let's write our first line of code. In Rise of Nations, all scripts must start with the "script" keyword. So go ahead and type that into your document now. After the word "script," hit the spacebar once and then type in a name for your script. This can be anything you want, but try to keep it short and descriptive. For this example, we'll call our script "MyFirstScript." Now hit enter/return to move to the next line.

On this next line, we're going to tell Rise of Nations what event we want our script to run on. For our first script, we're going to make it run when the game starts up. To do this, type in the word "startup." Now on this line, after startup, hit the spacebar twice and then type in a set of curly brackets "{ }." These curly brackets denote where our code will go. Everything we want our script to do needs to go between these curly brackets. Now hit enter/return again to move down one more line and we'll start writing some actual code!

The first thing we want our script to do is print out a message telling us that it's running. To do this, type in the word "print" (no quotes) followed by a set of double quotes "" and then whatever message you want it display. For our example, we'll just have it say "Hello world!" Now that we've written out our code, hit enter/return again and then go up to the "File" menu and select "Save As." Save your file somewhere you'll remember so you can find it later and
