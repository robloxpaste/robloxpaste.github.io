## How Common Is Apeirophobia?

Apeirophobia, or fear of apes, is relatively common. It's estimated that 1 in 25 people have some level of aversion to apes. Interestingly, apeophobia doesn't seem to be linked with any particular personality type. In fact, it appears to run in families. 

There are a few theories as to why people have a fear of apes. Some say it's due to our evolutionary history. Our ancestors might have been killed by primates, so we've developed this innate fear. Others believe that the human brain is hardwired to be afraid of apes because they share some superficial similarities with humans- such as being able to communicate and use tools. Whatever the reason may be, it's clear that apeophobia is not something you can just shake off like a bad cold!

If you're concerned about your own apeophobia, there are several ways you can try to overcome it. One method is to read about ape behavior and try to understand why we might have a fear of them. Another approach is exposure therapy- which involves gradually exposing yourself to images and sounds of apes in a safe and controlled environment. If you find that exposure therapy isn't working for you, consider medication or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of treatment that helps people change the way they think about their fears.
